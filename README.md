Rancher 2 UI driver for the [Xelon](https://www.xelon.ch/) IaaS platform.


## Using the Xelon UI Driver

See the Rancher Documentation on [how to add a node driver](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.x/en/admin-settings/drivers/node-drivers/)
to your installation. The relevant part is in 'Adding Custom Node Drivers':

1. From the Global view, choose Tools > Drivers in the navigation bar. From the Drivers page, select the Node Drivers tab. In version prior
to v2.2.0, you can select Node Drivers directly in the navigation bar.
2. Click Add Node Driver.
3. Complete the Add Node Driver form. Then click Create:

## Development

This package contains a small web-server that will serve up the custom driver UI at `http://localhost:3000/component.js`. You can run this
while developing and point the Rancher settings there.
* `npm start`
* The driver name can be optionally overridden: `npm start -- --name=DRIVERNAME`
* The compiled files are viewable at http://localhost:3000.
* **Note:** The development server does not currently automatically restart when files are changed.

## Building

For other users to see your driver, you need to build it and host the output on a server accessible from their browsers.

* `npm run build`
* Copy the contents of the `dist` directory onto a webserver.
  * If your Rancher is configured to use HA or SSL, the server must also be available via HTTPS.

## Release process

The release process uses continuous integration from CircelCI which means the code base should
be ready to release any time.

#### Checklist for releasing Xelon UI Driver

The below steps are for final release:

1. Check that latest build compiles and passes tests.
2. Trigger release creation by tagging git commit with
   ```bash
   # X.Y.Z. is a release version, e.g. 1.2.0
   $ git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "Release vX.Y.Z."
   ```
3. Wait for the build to finish and release created.
4. Update release information if needed
